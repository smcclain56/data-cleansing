# data-cleansing
This project was an assignment given in my undergraduate class, "Principles of Database Systems". We were given a problem in which a local college uses a software called "ShmeepleSoft" to manage its data. ShmeepleSoft has been collecting years worth of data on students and course enrollment in a single spreadsheet, and over time, the size of this file has gotten unmanageable. The project asked us to define a database schema in SQLite and to write a script that will take the data from its raw format and insert it into the database. Along the way, the script also resolves all of the anomalies in the text file (inconsistencies, redundancies, etc.).

My professor, David Chiu, supplied the raw ShmeepleSoft data for this assignment.
